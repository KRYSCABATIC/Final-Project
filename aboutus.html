 <h2>[ About Us ]</h2>
   <h2>Who we are & how we started</h2>
<br>Save the Angels began in 2018 as a small, urgent conversation between three neighbors:
<br>a public-school teacher, a community nurse, and a single mother who had lost a friend to an
<br>avoidable case of child neglect. What began as weekly neighborhood meetings, sharing tips,
<br>pooling resources, and running small school-based health drives, quickly grew into a formal
<br>volunteer collective when community members asked for help auditing school safety, running
<br>emergency first-aid trainings, and creating safe-reporting routes for children. 
<br>By 2019 we formally registered as a non-profit advocacy group in the Philippines to expand
<br>our programs and partner with local schools, health clinics, and barangay offices.
<br>
<br>Today Save the Angels is a community-led child protection and wellness organization that
<br>combines hands-on community outreach with policy advocacy and capacity building. 
<br>Our core activities include school safety audits, community caregiver workshops on nutrition 
<br>and mental health, child-friendly complaint and referral systems, and rapid-response support 
<br>for families in crisis. We place special emphasis on prevention — through education, accessible
<br>health services, and strengthening local referral networks — and on amplifying children’s voices 
<br>when decisions affecting them are made. Our work is rooted in the belief that every child deserves 
<br>safety, dignity, and the chance to grow up healthy and heard.
